&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi there, I’m Madelyn Stone, and I’m in my final year of undergrad at Northeastern. I’m double majoring in journalism and history with a minor in international affairs, hoping to go to grad school in the near future. My interests include South African and modern European cultural history, especially intellectual, legal, linguistic and art history.

<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I’m working on an honors thesis about South African art during apartheid as well as on a couple of projects looking at Jewish intellectuals in the 1930s. I’ve helped with the New England Hidden Histories project at the Congregational Library and Archives, collecting metadata on 18th century church records, and I’ve completed three co-ops during my time at Northeastern: at the technology news site TechTarget in Newton, the Cape Argus newspaper in Cape Town, and the history research institute South African History Online, also in Cape Town. 
<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work as an RA and in the library archives on campus. My hometown is a teensy place in North Carolina and a few of my favorite things include animals, traveling, museums, hiking, vegan baking, listening to NPR and various podcasts.
